## ‚úÖ Recent UI changes

- Weekly grouped timesheet view: timesheets are now grouped by week (Monday‚ÄìSunday) and display per-day status badges and a weekly overall status (APPROVED / REJECTED / PENDING). This view is read-only in the `TimesheetManagement` page so HR and employees can review historical weeks without performing approve/reject actions there.
- Manager approval workflow: managers should use the `TimesheetApproval` page to review pending weekly timesheets grouped by employee/project/week. Managers can approve or reject individual days within a week and provide rejection reasons when applicable.

## üß≠ Frontend (React) - Local development

To run the frontend locally (development mode with hot-reload):

```powershell
cd D:\website\frontend
$env:PORT=3000
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and log in with a demo account (see demo credentials in the frontend README). If you are logged in as HR open the "All Timesheets" (Manage) page to see the weekly grouped read-only view. Managers should use the "Timesheet Approval" page to act on pending timesheets.


#### Get All Employees
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/api/hr/employees \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer HR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

#### Get All Managers
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/api/hr/managers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer HR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Manager Endpoints (MANAGER Role Required)

#### View Managed Employee Timesheets
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/api/manager/timesheets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer MANAGER_JWT_TOKEN"
```

#### Approve Timesheet
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8081/api/manager/timesheets/1/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer MANAGER_JWT_TOKEN"
```

#### Reject Timesheet
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8081/api/manager/timesheets/1/reject \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer MANAGER_JWT_TOKEN"
```

#### View Managed Employees
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/api/manager/employees \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer MANAGER_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Employee Endpoints (EMPLOYEE Role Required)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/timesheets/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer EMPLOYEE_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": 1,
    "date": "2025-10-01",
    "hours": 8.0,
    "notes": "Working on authentication module"
  }'
```

## üß™ Testing

### Complete Workflow Testing
1. **Admin Setup**: Create HR, Manager, and Employee users
2. **HR Operations**: Create projects and assign employees
3. **Employee Actions**: Submit timesheets for assigned projects
4. **Manager Approval**: Review and approve/reject timesheets
5. **System Verification**: Check all role-based access controls

### Test Sequence
```bash
# 1. Create Admin user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Admin", "email": "admin@example.com", "password": "password123", "role": "ADMIN"}'

# 2. Admin creates HR user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/admin/users -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "HR Manager", "email": "hr@example.com", "password": "password123", "role": "HR"}'

# 3. HR creates project
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/hr/projects -H "Authorization: Bearer HR_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Test Project", "description": "Testing", "code": "TEST001", "client": "Test Client"}'

# 4. HR assigns employee to project
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/hr/assignments -H "Authorization: Bearer HR_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"employeeId": 4, "projectId": 1, "notes": "Test assignment"}'

# 5. Employee submits timesheet
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/timesheets/submit -H "Authorization: Bearer EMPLOYEE_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"projectId": 1, "hours": 8.0, "date": "2025-01-15", "notes": "Development work"}'

# 6. Manager approves timesheet
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8081/api/manager/timesheets/1/approve -H "Authorization: Bearer MANAGER_TOKEN"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Application Won't Start
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
# Verify database credentials in application.properties
# Check if port 8081 is available
```

#### JWT Token Issues
- Ensure token is included in Authorization header
- Verify token hasn't expired (24 hours)
- Check role-based access (MANAGER vs EMPLOYEE)

#### Database Connection Issues
- Verify PostgreSQL service is running
- Check database exists and user has permissions
- Confirm connection details in application.properties

### Health Checks
```bash
# Application health
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/health

# Database connection
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/metrics/jdbc.connections.active
```

## üìà Monitoring

### Available Actuator Endpoints
- `/actuator/health` - Application health status
- `/actuator/info` - Application information
- `/actuator/metrics` - Application metrics
- `/actuator/loggers` - Logger configuration

### Performance Monitoring
- AOP aspects log method execution times
- Slow operations (>1000ms) are logged as warnings
- Database connection pool monitoring via HikariCP
